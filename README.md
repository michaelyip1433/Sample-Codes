# Sample-Codes

This repository contains some of my coding samples in Python which are written in .ipynb. The repository is divided into 2 parts:

#### 1. Codes for my writing sample -- "Predicting Economic Recessions Using Technical Indicators"
This folder contains the Python codes of all prediction models in my writing sample. The codes for diagrams are written in a seperate iPython notebook. To save your computation time, all results have been saved in .pickle files, which are all uploaded here. The latest version of my writing sample is also contained in this folder. 



#### 2. Codes for numerical implementations of some macro models
