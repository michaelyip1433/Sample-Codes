# Sample-Codes

This repository contains some of my coding samples in Python which are written in .ipynb. The repository is divided into 2 parts:

#### 1. Codes for my writing sample -- "Predicting Economic Recessions Using Technical Indicators"
This folder contains the Python codes of all prediction models in my writing sample. The codes for diagrams are written in a seperate iPython notebook. To save your computation time, all results have been saved in .pickle files, which are all uploaded here. The latest version of my writing sample is also contained in this folder. 



#### 2. Codes for numerical implementations of macro models
This folder contains my experiments on numerical solutios of some simple macro models. They are some extension of the QuantEcon's lectures on similar topics. Since these experiments benefit hugely from QuantEcon, you need to first install the quantecon library before running these notebooks. Here are the references I relied on when I wrote these notebooks:

* Adda, J., & Cooper, R. (2003). Dynamic Economics: Quantitative Methods and Applications. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.
* Fehr, H., & Kindermann, F. (2018). Introduction to Computational Economics Using fortran. Oxford, U.K.: Oxford University Press.
